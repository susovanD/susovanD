### Hi there 👋 Welcome to my hub 😀

I am a Machine Learning Engineer a python web developer/scraper. 

I have developed Chromo, a chatbot 🤖 that helps users to order food online.

I love automating things and have made multiple utilities/scripts that will save us from doing the boring jobs. I have helped others also to automate their day to day boring tasks.

I have developed a text clustering tool that would differentiate organizational data (mainly Application Maintenance data). This in term helped the organization take proper measure after identiying the pain points post analysing the data.

Apart from coding, I love travelling, reading about Indian mythology. I love aquascaping too. 🐠☘️

Wanna know more about me? Stay tuned. 😀😀
